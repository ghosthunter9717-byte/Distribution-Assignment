        "   - The excel formula to generate the values is =RAND(). The resultin histogram is approximate a rectangular shape, which is characteristic of a uniform distribution.\n",

        "   - Standardization is a data transformation technique that rescales data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",

        "\n",
        "   - Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describe the \"tailedness\" of a distribution's probability distribution. The three main types are: Mesokurtic, Leptokurtic, and playkurtic.\n",

        "6. Explain why the uniform distribution is a good model for the outcome of rolling a fair die.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The uniform distriburion is a good model for the outcome of rolling a fair die because each of the six possible outcomes has an equal probability  of occurring.\n",

        "\n",
        "   - Log transformation helps by compairing larger values and stretching smaller values, which can stabilize variance and make data more normally distributed."
